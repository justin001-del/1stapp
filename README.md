# 📱 First Streamlit App – Phone Tracker (Prototype)

This was my **first Streamlit project**, made as a personal milestone to get comfortable with building and deploying a basic web app. 
And it's clearly ,not perfect yet 

 What it does:
- Basic UI for logging phone usage (inspired by screen time apps)
- Built using Streamlit + pandas
- Hosted via Streamlit Cloud

🔍 Why it looks unfinished:
This was done as a **learning-first** prototype.
No fancy design, minimal features — but it helped me:
- Understand Streamlit deployment
- Get started with interactive Python apps
- Learn by doing, not by overplanning

🚧 Status:
> Not maintained. Just a checkpoint in my journey.

**Next app is in progress** and will have:
- Better UI
- Real use-case logic
- Cleaner code

🛠️ _Made with curiosity, not perfection._
